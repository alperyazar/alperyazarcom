==============================================

	Created on February 25, 2017 and has not been updated yet.

I took a course on Information Theory, at METU Spring 2015 semester. I tried to prepare lecture notes for myself using LaTeX during semester. Finally I managed to compile them and decided to publish on the Internet similar to :ref:`page_lecturenotes_ee604` with permission from `Prof. Ali Ozgur Yilmaz <http://users.metu.edu.tr/aoyilmaz/>`__.

Lecture notes can be found there: :ref:`page_lecturenotes_ee533`.
