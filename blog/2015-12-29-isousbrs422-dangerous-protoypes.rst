Vow! Another great news after :ref:`page_blog_20151226_eevblog` post. `Dangerous Prototypes <http://www.dangerousprototypes.com)(DP)>`__ which is one of the best sites about electronics and open source hardware projects is kind enough to mention about :ref:`page_projects_isoUSBRS422` project.

Many thanks to DP. I am glad to see my project on such a reputable blog.
