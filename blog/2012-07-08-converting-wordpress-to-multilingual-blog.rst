Converting WordPress to a Multilingual Blog
===========================================

It is possible to create multilingual posts using a plugin called `qTranslate <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/>`__ with WordPress. For some reasons, you (like me) may wish to create multilingual posts in WordPress. qTranslate allows you to create not only multilingual posts but also multilingual category names, tags and even site names, descriptions etc.
